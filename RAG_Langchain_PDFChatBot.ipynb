Prior\\nQFS methods, meanwhile, fail to scale to the quantities of text indexed by typical\\nRAG systems. To combine the strengths of these contrasting methods, we propose\\na Graph RAG approach to question answering over private text corpora that scales\\nwith both the generality of user questions and the quantity of source text to be in-\\ndexed. Our approach uses an LLM to build a graph-based text index in two stages:\\nfirst to derive an entity knowledge graph from the source documents, then to pre-\\ngenerate community summaries for all groups of closely-related entities. Given a\\nquestion, each community summary is used to generate a partial response, before\\nall partial responses are again summarized in a final response to the user. For a\\nclass of global sensemaking questions over datasets in the 1 million token range,\\nwe show that Graph RAG leads to substantial improvements over a na ¨ıve RAG\\nbaseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers. An\\nopen-source, Python-based implementation of both global and local Graph RAG\\napproaches is forthcoming at https://aka .ms/graphrag .\\n1 Introduction\\nHuman endeavors across a range of domains rely on our ability to read and reason about large\\ncollections of documents, often reaching conclusions that go beyond anything stated in the source\\ntexts themselves. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), we are already witnessing\\nattempts to automate human-like sensemaking in complex domains like scientific discovery (Mi-\\ncrosoft, 2023) and intelligence analysis (Ranade and Joshi, 2023), where sensemaking is defined as\\nPreprint.

This\\nindex spans nodes (e.g., entities), edges (e.g., relationships), and covariates (e.g., claims) that have\\nbeen detected, extracted, and summarized by LLM prompts tailored to the domain of the dataset.\\nCommunity detection (e.g., Leiden, Traag et al., 2019) is used to partition the graph index into\\ngroups of elements (nodes, edges, covariates) that the LLM can summarize in parallel at both index-\\ning time and query time. The “global answer” to a given query is produced using a final round of\\nquery-focused summarization over all community summaries reporting relevance to that query.\\n“a motivated, continuous effort to understand connections (which can be among people, places, and\\nevents) in order to anticipate their trajectories and act effectively ” (Klein et al., 2006a). Supporting\\nhuman-led sensemaking over entire text corpora, however, needs a way for people to both apply and\\nrefine their mental model of the data (Klein et al., 2006b) by asking questions of a global nature.\\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG, Lewis et al., 2020) is an established approach to answering\\nuser questions over entire datasets, but it is designed for situations where these answers are contained\\nlocally within regions of text whose retrieval provides sufficient grounding for the generation task.\\nInstead, a more appropriate task framing is query-focused summarization (QFS, Dang, 2006), and in\\nparticular, query-focused abstractive summarization that generates natural language summaries and\\nnot just concatenated excerpts (Baumel et al., 2018; Laskar et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2017) . In recent\\nyears, however, such distinctions between summarization tasks that are abstractive versus extractive,\\ngeneric versus query-focused, and single-document versus multi-document, have become less rele-\\nvant. While early applications of the transformer architecture showed substantial improvements on\\nthe state-of-the-art for all such summarization tasks (Goodwin et al., 2020; Laskar et al., 2022; Liu\\nand Lapata, 2019), these tasks are now trivialized by modern LLMs, including the GPT (Achiam\\net al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020), Llama (Touvron et al., 2023), and Gemini (Anil et al., 2023) series,\\nall of which can use in-context learning to summarize any content provided in their context window.\\nThe challenge remains, however, for query-focused abstractive summarization over an entire corpus.\\nSuch volumes of text can greatly exceed the limits of LLM context windows, and the expansion of\\nsuch windows may not be enough given that information can be “lost in the middle” of longer\\ncontexts (Kuratov et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). In addition, although the direct retrieval of text\\nchunks in na ¨ıve RAG is likely inadequate for QFS tasks, it is possible that an alternative form of\\npre-indexing could support a new RAG approach specifically targeting global summarization.\\nIn this paper, we present a Graph RAG approach based on global summarization of an LLM-derived\\nknowledge graph (Figure 1). In contrast with related work that exploits the structured retrieval\\nand traversal affordances of graph indexes (subsection 4.2), we focus on a previously unexplored\\nquality of graphs in this context: their inherent modularity (Newman, 2006) and the ability of com-\\nmunity detection algorithms to partition graphs into modular communities of closely-related nodes\\n(e.g., Louvain, Blondel et al., 2008; Leiden, Traag et al., 2019). LLM-generated summaries of these\\n20 1 2 30100002000030000\\nNumber of gleanings performedEntity references detected600 chunk size\\n1200 chunk size\\n2400 chunk size\\nFigure 2: How the entity references detected in the HotPotQA dataset (Yang et al., 2018)\\nvaries with chunk size and gleanings for our generic entity extraction prompt with gpt-4-turbo .\\ncommunity descriptions provide complete coverage of the underlying graph index and the input doc-\\numents it represents. Query-focused summarization of an entire corpus is then made possible using\\na map-reduce approach: first using each community summary to answer the query independently\\nand in parallel, then summarizing all relevant partial answers into a final global answer.\\nTo evaluate this approach, we used an LLM to generate a diverse set of activity-centered sense-\\nmaking questions from short descriptions of two representative real-world datasets, containing pod-\\ncast transcripts and news articles respectively. For the target qualities of comprehensiveness, diver-\\nsity, and empowerment (defined in subsection 3.4) that develop understanding of broad issues and\\nthemes, we both explore the impact of varying the the hierarchical level of community summaries\\nused to answer queries, as well as compare to na ¨ıve RAG and global map-reduce summarization\\nof source texts. We show that all global approaches outperform na ¨ıve RAG on comprehensiveness\\nand diversity, and that Graph RAG with intermediate- and low-level community summaries shows\\nfavorable performance over source text summarization on these same metrics, at lower token costs.\\n2 Graph RAG Approach & Pipeline\\nWe now unpack the high-level data flow of the Graph RAG approach (Figure 1) and pipeline, de-\\nscribing key design parameters, techniques, and implementation details for each step.\\n2.1 Source Documents →Text Chunks\\nA fundamental design decision is the granularity with which input texts extracted from source doc-\\numents should be split into text chunks for processing. In the following step, each of these chunks\\nwill be passed to a set of LLM prompts designed to extract the various elements of a graph index.\\nLonger text chunks require fewer LLM calls for such extraction, but suffer from the recall degrada-\\ntion of longer LLM context windows (Kuratov et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). This behavior can be\\nobserved in Figure 2 in the case of a single extraction round (i.e., with zero gleanings): on a sample\\ndataset (HotPotQA, Yang et al., 2018), using a chunk size of 600 token extracted almost twice as\\nmany entity references as when using a chunk size of 2400. While more references are generally\\nbetter, any extraction process needs to balance recall and precision for the target activity.\\n2.2 Text Chunks →Element Instances\\nThe baseline requirement for this step is to identify and extract instances of graph nodes and edges\\nfrom each chunk of source text. We do this using a multipart LLM prompt that first identifies all\\nentities in the text, including their name, type, and description, before identifying all relationships\\nbetween clearly-related entities, including the source and target entities and a description of their\\nrelationship. Both kinds of element instance are output in a single list of delimited tuples.\\nThe primary opportunity to tailor this prompt to the domain of the document corpus lies in the\\nchoice of few-shot examples provided to the LLM for in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020).\\n3For example, while our default prompt extracting the broad class of “named entities” like people,\\nplaces, and organizations is generally applicable, domains with specialized knowledge (e.g., science,\\nmedicine, law) will benefit from few-shot examples specialized to those domains. We also support\\na secondary extraction prompt for any additional covariates we would like to associate with the\\nextracted node instances. Our default covariate prompt aims to extract claims linked to detected\\nentities, including the subject, object, type, description, source text span, and start and end dates.\\nTo balance the needs of efficiency and quality, we use multiple rounds of “gleanings”, up to a\\nspecified maximum, to encourage the LLM to detect any additional entities it may have missed\\non prior extraction rounds. This is a multi-stage process in which we first ask the LLM to assess\\nwhether all entities were extracted, using a logit bias of 100 to force a yes/no decision. If the LLM\\nresponds that entities were missed, then a continuation indicating that “MANY entities were missed\\nin the last extraction” encourages the LLM to glean these missing entities. This approach allows us\\nto use larger chunk sizes without a drop in quality (Figure 2) or the forced introduction of noise.\\n2.3 Element Instances →Element Summaries\\nThe use of an LLM to “extract” descriptions of entities, relationships, and claims represented in\\nsource texts is already a form of abstractive summarization, relying on the LLM to create inde-\\npendently meaningful summaries of concepts that may be implied but not stated by the text itself\\n(e.g., the presence of implied relationships). To convert all such instance-level summaries into sin-\\ngle blocks of descriptive text for each graph element (i.e., entity node, relationship edge, and claim\\ncovariate) requires a further round of LLM summarization over matching groups of instances.\\nA potential concern at this stage is that the LLM may not consistently extract references to the\\nsame entity in the same text format, resulting in duplicate entity elements and thus duplicate nodes\\nin the entity graph. However, since all closely-related “communities” of entities will be detected\\nand summarized in the following step, and given that LLMs can understand the common entity\\nbehind multiple name variations, our overall approach is resilient to such variations provided there\\nis sufficient connectivity from all variations to a shared set of closely-related entities.\\nOverall, our use of rich descriptive text for homogeneous nodes in a potentially noisy graph structure\\nis aligned with both the capabilities of LLMs and the needs of global, query-focused summarization.\\nThese qualities also differentiate our graph index from typical knowledge graphs, which rely on\\nconcise and consistent knowledge triples (subject, predicate, object) for downstream reasoning tasks.\\n2.4 Element Summaries →Graph Communities\\nThe index created in the previous step can be modelled as an homogeneous undirected weighted\\ngraph in which entity nodes are connected by relationship edges, with edge weights representing the\\nnormalized counts of detected relationship instances. Given such a graph, a variety of community\\ndetection algorithms may be used to partition the graph into communities of nodes with stronger\\nconnections to one another than to the other nodes in the graph (e.g., see the surveys by Fortu-\\nnato, 2010 and Jin et al., 2021). In our pipeline, we use Leiden (Traag et al., 2019) on account of\\nits ability to recover hierarchical community structure of large-scale graphs efficiently (Figure 3).\\nEach level of this hierarchy provides a community partition that covers the nodes of the graph in a\\nmutually-exclusive, collective-exhaustive way, enabling divide-and-conquer global summarization.\\n2.5 Graph Communities →Community Summaries\\nThe next step is to create report-like summaries of each community in the Leiden hierarchy, using\\na method designed to scale to very large datasets. These summaries are independently useful in\\ntheir own right as a way to understand the global structure and semantics of the dataset, and may\\nthemselves be used to make sense of a corpus in the absence of a question. For example, a user\\nmay scan through community summaries at one level looking for general themes of interest, then\\nfollow links to the reports at the lower level that provide more details for each of the subtopics. Here,\\nhowever, we focus on their utility as part of a graph-based index used for answering global queries.\\nCommunity summaries are generated in the following way:\\n4(a) Root communities at level 0 (b) Sub-communities at level 1\\nFigure 3: Graph communities detected using the Leiden algorithm (Traag et al., 2019) over the\\nMultiHop-RAG (Tang and Yang, 2024) dataset as indexed. Circles represent entity nodes with size\\nproportional to their degree. Node layout was performed via OpenORD (Martin et al., 2011) and\\nForce Atlas 2 (Jacomy et al., 2014). Node colors represent entity communities, shown at two levels\\nof hierarchical clustering: (a) Level 0, corresponding to the hierarchical partition with maximum\\nmodularity, and (b) Level 1, which reveals internal structure within these root-level communities.\\n•Leaf-level communities . The element summaries of a leaf-level community (nodes, edges,\\ncovariates) are prioritized and then iteratively added to the LLM context window until\\nthe token limit is reached. The prioritization is as follows: for each community edge in\\ndecreasing order of combined source and target node degree (i.e., overall prominance), add\\ndescriptions of the source node, target node, linked covariates, and the edge itself.\\n•Higher-level communities . If all element summaries fit within the token limit of the con-\\ntext window, proceed as for leaf-level communities and summarize all element summaries\\nwithin the community. Otherwise, rank sub-communities in decreasing order of element\\nsummary tokens and iteratively substitute sub-community summaries (shorter) for their\\nassociated element summaries (longer) until fit within the context window is achieved.\\n2.6 Community Summaries →Community Answers →Global Answer\\nGiven a user query, the community summaries generated in the previous step can be used to generate\\na final answer in a multi-stage process. The hierarchical nature of the community structure also\\nmeans that questions can be answered using the community summaries from different levels, raising\\nthe question of whether a particular level in the hierarchical community structure offers the best\\nbalance of summary detail and scope for general sensemaking questions (evaluated in section 3).\\nFor a given community level, the global answer to any user query is generated as follows:\\n•Prepare community summaries . Community summaries are randomly shuffled and divided\\ninto chunks of pre-specified token size. This ensures relevant information is distributed\\nacross chunks, rather than concentrated (and potentially lost) in a single context window.\\n•Map community answers . Generate intermediate answers in parallel, one for each chunk.\\nThe LLM is also asked to generate a score between 0-100 indicating how helpful the gen-\\nerated answer is in answering the target question. Answers with score 0 are filtered out.\\n•Reduce to global answer . Intermediate community answers are sorted in descending order\\nof helpfulness score and iteratively added into a new context window until the token limit\\nis reached. This final context is used to generate the global answer returned to the user.\\n5Dataset Example activity framing and generation of global sensemaking questions\\nPodcast\\ntranscriptsUser : A tech journalist looking for insights and trends in the tech industry\\nTask: Understanding how tech leaders view the role of policy and regulation\\nQuestions :\\n1.

Questions target global understanding rather than specific details.\\n3 Evaluation\\n3.1 Datasets\\nWe selected two datasets in the one million token range, each equivalent to about 10 novels of text\\nand representative of the kind of corpora that users may encounter in their real world activities:\\n•Podcast transcripts . Compiled transcripts of podcast conversations between Kevin Scott,\\nMicrosoft CTO, and other technology leaders (Behind the Tech, Scott, 2024). Size: 1669\\n×600-token text chunks, with 100-token overlaps between chunks ( ∼1 million tokens).\\n•News articles . Benchmark dataset comprising news articles published from September\\n2013 to December 2023 in a range of categories, including entertainment, business, sports,\\ntechnology, health, and science (MultiHop-RAG; Tang and Yang, 2024). Size: 3197 ×\\n600-token text chunks, with 100-token overlaps between chunks ( ∼1.7 million tokens).\\n3.2 Queries\\nMany benchmark datasets for open-domain question answering exist, including HotPotQA (Yang\\net al., 2018), MultiHop-RAG (Tang and Yang, 2024), and MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2024). However,\\nthe associated question sets target explicit fact retrieval rather than summarization for the purpose\\nof data sensemaking, i.e., the process though which people inspect, engage with, and contextualize\\ndata within the broader scope of real-world activities (Koesten et al., 2021). Similarly, methods for\\nextracting latent summarization queries from source texts also exist (Xu and Lapata, 2021), but such\\nextracted questions can target details that betray prior knowledge of the texts.\\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of RAG systems for more global sensemaking tasks, we need questions\\nthat convey only a high-level understanding of dataset contents, and not the details of specific texts.\\nWe used an activity-centered approach to automate the generation of such questions: given a short\\ndescription of a dataset, we asked the LLM to identify Npotential users and Ntasks per user,\\nthen for each (user, task) combination, we asked the LLM to generate Nquestions that require\\nunderstanding of the entire corpus. For our evaluation, a value of N= 5 resulted in 125 test questions\\nper dataset. Table 1 shows example questions for each of the two evaluation datasets.\\n63.3 Conditions\\nWe compare six different conditions in our analysis, including Graph RAG using four levels of graph\\ncommunities ( C0,C1,C2,C3), a text summarization method applying our map-reduce approach\\ndirectly to source texts ( TS), and a na ¨ıve “semantic search” RAG approach ( SS):\\n•CO. Uses root-level community summaries (fewest in number) to answer user queries.\\n•C1. Uses high-level community summaries to answer queries. These are sub-communities\\nof C0, if present, otherwise C0 communities projected down.\\n•C2. Uses intermediate-level community summaries to answer queries. These are sub-\\ncommunities of C1, if present, otherwise C1 communities projected down.\\n•C3. Uses low-level community summaries (greatest in number) to answer queries. These\\nare sub-communities of C2, if present, otherwise C2 communities projected down.\\n•TS. The same method as in subsection 2.6, except source texts (rather than community\\nsummaries) are shuffled and chunked for the map-reduce summarization stages.\\n•SS. An implementation of na ¨ıve RAG in which text chunks are retrieved and added to the\\navailable context window until the specified token limit is reached.\\nThe size of the context window and the prompts used for answer generation are the same across\\nall six conditions (except for minor modifications to reference styles to match the types of context\\ninformation used). Conditions only differ in how the contents of the context window are created.\\nThe graph index supporting conditions C0-C3was created using our generic prompts for entity and\\nrelationship extraction only, with entity types and few-shot examples tailored to the domain of the\\ndata. The graph indexing process used a context window size of 600 tokens with 1 gleaning for the\\nPodcast dataset and 0 gleanings for the News dataset.\\n3.4 Metrics\\nLLMs have been shown to be good evaluators of natural language generation, achieving state-of-\\nthe-art or competitive results compared against human judgements (Wang et al., 2023a; Zheng et al.,\\n2024). While this approach can generate reference-based metrics when gold standard answers are\\nknown, it is also capable of measuring the qualities of generated texts (e.g., fluency) in a reference-\\nfree style (Wang et al., 2023a) as well as in head-to-head comparison of competing outputs (LLM-\\nas-a-judge, Zheng et al., 2024). LLMs have also shown promise at evaluating the performance of\\nconventional RAG systems, automatically evaluating qualities like context relevance, faithfulness,\\nand answer relevance (RAGAS, Es et al., 2023).\\nGiven the multi-stage nature of our Graph RAG mechanism, the multiple conditions we wanted to\\ncompare, and the lack of gold standard answers to our activity-based sensemaking questions, we\\ndecided to adopt a head-to-head comparison approach using an LLM evaluator. We selected three\\ntarget metrics capturing qualities that are desirable for sensemaking activities, as well as a control\\nmetric (directness) used as a indicator of validity. Since directness is effectively in opposition to\\ncomprehensiveness and diversity, we would not expect any method to win across all four metrics.\\nOur head-to-head measures computed using an LLM evaluator are as follows:\\n•Comprehensiveness . How much detail does the answer provide to cover all aspects and\\ndetails of the question?\\n•Diversity . How varied and rich is the answer in providing different perspectives and insights\\non the question?\\n•Empowerment . How well does the answer help the reader understand and make informed\\njudgements about the topic?\\n•Directness . How specifically and clearly does the answer address the question?\\nFor our evaluation, the LLM is provided with the question, target metric, and a pair of answers, and\\nasked to assess which answer is better according to the metric, as well as why. It returns the winner\\nif one exists, otherwise a tie if they are fundamentally similar and the differences are negligible.\\nTo account for the stochasticity of LLMs, we run each comparison five times and use mean scores.\\nTable 2 shows an example of LLM-generated assessment.\\n7Question Which public figures are repeatedly mentioned across various entertainment articles?\\nGraph\\nRAGOverview of Prominent Public Figures in Entertainment\\nThe entertainment industry is vast and diverse, encompassing film, television, music, sports, and\\ndigital media. Certain public figures stand out due to their significant contributions and influence\\nacross these sectors. The following summary highlights key individuals who are repeatedly\\nmentioned in various entertainment articles, reflecting their impact and presence within the industry.\\nActors and Directors [...]Public Figures in Controversy [...]Musicians and Executives [...]\\nAthletes and Coaches [...]Influencers and Entrepreneurs [...]\\nThe repeated mention of these figures in entertainment articles signifies their ongoing relevance and\\nthe public’s interest in their work. Their influence spans across various aspects of entertainment, from\\nshaping cultural narratives in film and television to driving trends in music and digital media. These\\nindividuals not only contribute to their respective fields but also influence the broader cultural\\nlandscape, often becoming central figures in social discussions and public discourse.\\nNa¨ıve\\nRAGPublic figures who are repeatedly mentioned across various entertainment articles include Taylor\\nSwift, Travis Kelce, Britney Spears, and Justin Timberlake. These individuals have been highlighted\\nfor various reasons, ranging from their professional achievements to their personal lives.\\nTaylor Swift [...]Travis Kelce [...]Britney Spears [...]Justin Timberlake [...]\\nThese figures are frequently covered due to their high-profile status and the public’s interest in their\\ncareers and personal lives. Their activities, whether in music, sports, or personal relationships, have\\nsignificant cultural and economic impacts, as evidenced by the media coverage and public reactions.\\nLLM\\nDecisionComprehensiveness: Winner=1 (Graph RAG)\\nAnswer 1 is better because it provides a more comprehensive and detailed list of public figures from a\\nwider range of entertainment sectors, including film, television, music, sports, gaming, and digital\\nmedia. It also includes specific examples of their contributions and the impact they have on their\\nrespective fields, as well as mentions of controversies and their implications. Answer 2, while\\ndetailed in its coverage of a few individuals, is limited to a smaller number of public figures and\\nfocuses primarily on their personal lives and relationships rather than a broad spectrum of their\\nprofessional influence across the entertainment industry.\\nDiversity: Winner=1 (Graph RAG)\\nAnswer 1 is better because it provides a more varied and rich response by covering a wide range of\\npublic figures from different sectors of the entertainment industry, including film, television, music,\\nsports, gaming, and digital media. It offers insights into the contributions and influence of these\\nfigures, as well as controversies and their impact on public discourse. The answer also cites specific\\ndata sources for each mentioned figure, indicating a diverse range of evidence to support the claims.\\nIn contrast, Answer 2 focuses on a smaller group of public figures, primarily from the music industry\\nand sports, and relies heavily on a single source for data, which makes it less diverse in perspectives\\nand insights.\\nEmpowerment: Winner=1 (Graph RAG)\\nAnswer 1 is better because it provides a comprehensive and structured overview of public figures\\nacross various sectors of the entertainment industry, including film, television, music, sports, and\\ndigital media. It lists multiple individuals, providing specific examples of their contributions and the\\ncontext in which they are mentioned in entertainment articles, along with references to data reports\\nfor each claim. This approach helps the reader understand the breadth of the topic and make informed\\njudgments without being misled. In contrast, Answer 2 focuses on a smaller group of public figures\\nand primarily discusses their personal lives and relationships, which may not provide as broad an\\nunderstanding of the topic. While Answer 2 also cites sources, it does not match the depth and variety\\nof Answer 1.\\nDirectness: Winner=2 (Na ¨ıve RAG)\\nAnswer 2 is better because it directly lists specific public figures who are repeatedly mentioned\\nacross various entertainment articles, such as Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce, Britney Spears, and Justin\\nTimberlake, and provides concise explanations for their frequent mentions. Answer 1, while\\ncomprehensive, includes a lot of detailed information about various figures in different sectors of\\nentertainment, which, while informative, does not directly answer the question with the same level of\\nconciseness and specificity as Answer 2.\\nTable 2: Example question for the News article dataset, with generated answers from Graph RAG\\n(C2) and Na ¨ıve RAG, as well as LLM-generated assessments.\\n8Podcast transcripts\\n501728252221\\n835050484344\\n725050535049\\n755247505250\\n785750485052\\n795651504850SS\\nTS\\nC0\\nC1\\nC2\\nC3SSTSC0C1C2C3\\nComprehensiveness501823251919\\n825050504346\\n775050504644\\n755050504445\\n815754565048\\n815456555250SS\\nTS\\nC0\\nC1\\nC2\\nC3SSTSC0C1C2C3\\nDiversity504257524951\\n585059555251\\n434150494748\\n484551504950\\n514853515051\\n494952504950SS\\nTS\\nC0\\nC1\\nC2\\nC3SSTSC0C1C2C3\\nEmpowerment505665606060\\n445055525152\\n354550474848\\n404853505050\\n404952505050\\n404852505050SS\\nTS\\nC0\\nC1\\nC2\\nC3SSTSC0C1C2C3\\nDirectness\\nNews articles\\n502028252121\\n805044413836\\n725650525452\\n755948505855\\n796246425059\\n796448454150SS\\nTS\\nC0\\nC1\\nC2\\nC3SSTSC0C1C2C3\\nComprehensiveness503338352931\\n675053454440\\n624750404141\\n655560505050\\n715659505051\\n696059504950SS\\nTS\\nC0\\nC1\\nC2\\nC3SSTSC0C1C2C3\\nDiversity504757495050\\n535058505048\\n434250424544\\n515058505251\\n505055485050\\n505256495050SS\\nTS\\nC0\\nC1\\nC2\\nC3SSTSC0C1C2C3\\nEmpowerment505459555554\\n465055535252\\n414550484847\\n454752504949\\n454852515049\\n464853515150SS\\nTS\\nC0\\nC1\\nC2\\nC3SSTSC0C1C2C3\\nDirectness\\nFigure 4: Head-to-head win rate percentages of (row condition) over (column condition) across two\\ndatasets, four metrics, and 125 questions per comparison (each repeated five times and averaged).\\nThe overall winner per dataset and metric is shown in bold.

Conditions C1-C3 also showed slight improvements in answer\\ncomprehensiveness and diversity over TS (global text summarization without a graph index).\\n3.5 Configuration\\nThe effect of context window size on any particular task is unclear, especially for models like\\ngpt-4-turbo with a large context size of 128k tokens. Given the potential for information to\\nbe “lost in the middle” of longer contexts (Kuratov et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023), we wanted to ex-\\nplore the effects of varying the context window size for our combinations of datasets, questions, and\\nmetrics. In particular, our goal was to determine the optimum context size for our baseline condition\\n(SS) and then use this uniformly for all query-time LLM use. To that end, we tested four context\\nwindow sizes: 8k, 16k, 32k and 64k. Surprisingly, the smallest context window size tested (8k)\\nwas universally better for all comparisons on comprehensiveness (average win rate of 58.1%), while\\nperforming comparably with larger context sizes on diversity (average win rate = 52.4%), and em-\\npowerment (average win rate = 51.3%). Given our preference for more comprehensive and diverse\\nanswers, we therefore used a fixed context window size of 8k tokens for the final evaluation.\\n3.6 Results\\nThe indexing process resulted in a graph consisting of 8564 nodes and 20691 edges for the Podcast\\ndataset, and a larger graph of 15754 nodes and 19520 edges for the News dataset. Table 3 shows the\\nnumber of community summaries at different levels of each graph community hierarchy.\\nGlobal approaches vs. na ¨ıve RAG . As shown in Figure 4, global approaches consistently out-\\nperformed the na ¨ıve RAG ( SS) approach in both comprehensiveness and diversity metrics across\\ndatasets. Specifically, global approaches achieved comprehensiveness win rates between 72-83%\\nfor Podcast transcripts and 72-80% for News articles, while diversity win rates ranged from 75-82%\\nand 62-71% respectively. Our use of directness as a validity test also achieved the expected results,\\ni.e., that na ¨ıve RAG produces the most direct responses across all comparisons.\\n9Podcast Transcripts News Articles\\nC0 C1 C2 C3 TS C0 C1 C2 C3 TS\\nUnits 34 367 969 1310 1669 55 555 1797 2142 3197\\nTokens 26657 225756 565720 746100 1014611 39770 352641 980898 1140266 1707694\\n% Max 2.6 22.2 55.8 73.5 100 2.3 20.7 57.4 66.8 100\\nTable 3: Number of context units (community summaries for C0-C3 and text chunks for TS), corre-\\nsponding token counts, and percentage of the maximum token count.

Table 3\\nalso illustrates the scalability advantages of Graph RAG compared to source text summarization: for\\nlow-level community summaries ( C3), Graph RAG required 26-33% fewer context tokens, while\\nfor root-level community summaries ( C0), it required over 97% fewer tokens. For a modest drop in\\nperformance compared with other global methods, root-level Graph RAG offers a highly efficient\\nmethod for the iterative question answering that characterizes sensemaking activity, while retaining\\nadvantages in comprehensiveness (72% win rate) and diversity (62% win rate) over na ¨ıve RAG.\\nEmpowerment . Empowerment comparisons showed mixed results for both global approaches versus\\nna¨ıve RAG ( SS) and Graph RAG approaches versus source text summarization ( TS). Ad-hoc LLM\\nuse to analyze LLM reasoning for this measure indicated that the ability to provide specific exam-\\nples, quotes, and citations was judged to be key to helping users reach an informed understanding.\\nTuning element extraction prompts may help to retain more of these details in the Graph RAG index.\\n4 Related Work\\n4.1 RAG Approaches and Systems\\nWhen using LLMs, RAG involves first retrieving relevant information from external data sources,\\nthen adding this information to the context window of the LLM along with the original query (Ram\\net al., 2023). Na ¨ıve RAG approaches (Gao et al., 2023) do this by converting documents to text,\\nsplitting text into chunks, and embedding these chunks into a vector space in which similar positions\\nrepresent similar semantics. Queries are then embedded into the same vector space, with the text\\nchunks of the nearest kvectors used as context. More advanced variations exist, but all solve the\\nproblem of what to do when an external dataset of interest exceeds the LLM’s context window.\\nAdvanced RAG systems include pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval strategies designed to over-\\ncome the drawbacks of Na ¨ıve RAG, while Modular RAG systems include patterns for iterative and\\ndynamic cycles of interleaved retrieval and generation (Gao et al., 2023). Our implementation of\\nGraph RAG incorporates multiple concepts related to other systems. For example, our community\\nsummaries are a kind of self-memory (Selfmem, Cheng et al., 2024) for generation-augmented re-\\ntrieval (GAR, Mao et al., 2020) that facilitates future generation cycles, while our parallel generation\\nof community answers from these summaries is a kind of iterative (Iter-RetGen, Shao et al., 2023)\\nor federated (FeB4RAG, Wang et al., 2024) retrieval-generation strategy. Other systems have also\\ncombined these concepts for multi-document summarization (CAiRE-COVID, Su et al., 2020) and\\nmulti-hop question answering (ITRG, Feng et al., 2023; IR-CoT, Trivedi et al., 2022; DSP, Khattab\\net al., 2022). Our use of a hierarchical index and summarization also bears resemblance to further\\napproaches, such as generating a hierarchical index of text chunks by clustering the vectors of text\\nembeddings (RAPTOR, Sarthi et al., 2024) or generating a “tree of clarifications” to answer mul-\\ntiple interpretations of ambiguous questions (Kim et al., 2023). However, none of these iterative or\\nhierarchical approaches use the kind of self-generated graph index that enables Graph RAG.\\n104.2 Graphs and LLMs\\nUse of graphs in connection with LLMs and RAG is a developing research area, with multiple\\ndirections already established. These include using LLMs for knowledge graph creation (Tra-\\njanoska et al., 2023) and completion (Yao et al., 2023), as well as for the extraction of causal\\ngraphs (Ban et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024) from source texts. They also include forms of ad-\\nvanced RAG (Gao et al., 2023) where the index is a knowledge graph (KAPING, Baek et al., 2023),\\nwhere subsets of the graph structure (G-Retriever, He et al., 2024) or derived graph metrics (Graph-\\nToolFormer, Zhang, 2023) are the objects of enquiry, where narrative outputs are strongly grounded\\nin the facts of retrieved subgraphs (SURGE, Kang et al., 2023), where retrieved event-plot sub-\\ngraphs are serialized using narrative templates (FABULA, Ranade and Joshi, 2023), and where the\\nsystem supports both creation and traversal of text-relationship graphs for multi-hop question an-\\nswering (Wang et al., 2023b). In terms of open-source software, a variety a graph databases are\\nsupported by both the LangChain (LangChain, 2024) and LlamaIndex (LlamaIndex, 2024) libraries,\\nwhile a more general class of graph-based RAG applications is also emerging, including systems that\\ncan create and reason over knowledge graphs in both Neo4J (NaLLM, Neo4J, 2024) and Nebula-\\nGraph (GraphRAG, NebulaGraph, 2024) formats. Unlike our Graph RAG approach, however, none\\nof these systems use the natural modularity of graphs to partition data for global summarization.\\n5 Discussion\\nLimitations of evaluation approach . Our evaluation to date has only examined a certain class of\\nsensemaking questions for two corpora in the region of 1 million tokens. More work is needed\\nto understand how performance varies across different ranges of question types, data types, and\\ndataset sizes, as well as to validate our sensemaking questions and target metrics with end users.\\nComparison of fabrication rates, e.g., using approaches like SelfCheckGPT (Manakul et al., 2023),\\nwould also improve on the current analysis.\\nTrade-offs of building a graph index . We consistently observed Graph RAG achieve the best head-\\nto-head results against other methods, but in many cases the graph-free approach to global summa-\\nrization of source texts performed competitively. The real-world decision about whether to invest in\\nbuilding a graph index depends on multiple factors, including the compute budget, expected number\\nof lifetime queries per dataset, and value obtained from other aspects of the graph index (including\\nthe generic community summaries and the use of other graph-related RAG approaches).\\nFuture work . The graph index, rich text annotations, and hierarchical community structure support-\\ning the current Graph RAG approach offer many possibilities for refinement and adaptation. This\\nincludes RAG approaches that operate in a more local manner, via embedding-based matching of\\nuser queries and graph annotations, as well as the possibility of hybrid RAG schemes that combine\\nembedding-based matching against community reports before employing our map-reduce summa-\\nrization mechanisms. This “roll-up” operation could also be extended across more levels of the\\ncommunity hierarchy, as well as implemented as a more exploratory “drill down” mechanism that\\nfollows the information scent contained in higher-level community summaries.\\n6 Conclusion\\nWe have presented a global approach to Graph RAG, combining knowledge graph generation,\\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and query-focused summarization (QFS) to support human\\nsensemaking over entire text corpora. Initial evaluations show substantial improvements over a\\nna¨ıve RAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of answers, as well as favorable\\ncomparisons to a global but graph-free approach using map-reduce source text summarization. For\\nsituations requiring many global queries over the same dataset, summaries of root-level communi-\\nties in the entity-based graph index provide a data index that is both superior to na ¨ıve RAG and\\nachieves competitive performance to other global methods at a fraction of the token cost.\\nAn open-source, Python-based implementation of both global and local Graph RAG approaches is\\nforthcoming at https://aka .ms/graphrag .\\n11Acknowledgements\\nWe would also like to thank the following people who contributed to the work: Alonso Guevara\\nFern ´andez, Amber Hoak, Andr ´es Morales Esquivel, Ben Cutler, Billie Rinaldi, Chris Sanchez,\\nChris Trevino, Christine Caggiano, David Tittsworth, Dayenne de Souza, Douglas Orbaker, Ed\\nClark, Gabriel Nieves-Ponce, Gaudy Blanco Meneses, Kate Lytvynets, Katy Smith, M ´onica Carva-\\njal, Nathan Evans, Richard Ortega, Rodrigo Racanicci, Sarah Smith, and Shane Solomon.\\nReferences\\nAchiam, J., Adler, S., Agarwal, S., Ahmad, L., Akkaya, I., Aleman, F.
